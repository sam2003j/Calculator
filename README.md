## Introduction
This is a simple Java calculator application built using Swing. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as decimal point input and the ability to clear and delete entries. The calculator also supports changing the sign of the displayed number.

## Features
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Decimal point input for non-integer numbers.
Clear and delete buttons for ease of use.
Change the sign of the displayed number.
User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).


## Usage
- Clone the repository:
```markdown
git clone https://github.com/sam2003j/Calculator.git
```
- Compile: 
```markdown
javac Calculator.java
```
- Run the compiled program:
```markdown
java Calculator
```

## Working
- The calculator GUI is built using Swing components, including buttons and a text field to display input and results.
- Users can input numbers and perform calculations by clicking on the appropriate buttons.
- The Del button allows users to delete the last digit entered, and the Clr button clears the entire input field.
- The (-) button changes the sign of the displayed number, making it easy to switch between positive and negative values.
- When the user clicks an operation button (+, -, *, /), the first number is stored, and the input field is cleared for the second number.
- Clicking the "=" button calculates the result and displays it in the input field.
